This Python script reads sales data from a CSV file (sales_data.csv), analyzes it to compute metrics like total units sold, total revenue, average revenue per sale, and top-performing product, and generates a formatted PDF report using ReportLab. The report includes a title, a summary section with key statistics, a styled table of the raw data, and a line chart showing revenue trends by product. The output is saved as sales_report.pdf, a single-page A4 document with professional formatting.
